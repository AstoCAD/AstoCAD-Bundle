# FreeCAD-AppImage
Stand-alone repo to generate and deploy the [FreeCAD AppImage](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImages/tree/master/recipes/freecad) built from the FreeCAD [daily PPA](https://launchpad.net/~freecad-maintainers/+archive/ubuntu/freecad-daily) until such time that the [openSUSE OBS](https://build.opensuse.org) obviates the need.
